Project 2: Credit card fraud detection - Comparision of various supervised learning methods and Sampling methods
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite technology and overall awareness, credit card fraud is on the rise and so are the different types of credit card scams. Fraud transactions contribute to heavy losses for the credit card issuers and Card holders get flagged on the credit report, may result in higher interest rates and administration fees. With the nature of the scams getting newer and more sophisticated, there is a need to better improve the performance of fraud detection models. The objective of the project is to classify a transaction as either fraudulent or legitimate based on the features of a transaction, however the challange is heavy imbalance in the data. The project explores various supervised learning methods combined with the most popular sampling methods.
