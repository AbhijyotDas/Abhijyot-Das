Project 1: Predicting the probability of Loan Default in Peer to Peer lending Market
=======================================================================================

The motive of the project is to solve the problem of information asymmetry that persists in the peer to peer lending market. The objective is to predict
probability of a loan default. We would like the model to help both the lenders and lending intermediaries to make investment decisions.
